This entry is yet another post-[fCC challenge](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer) stream-of-consciousness sort of post. I just finished coding a [wikipedia viewer webpage](http://jsbin.com/loqezor), with an old-timey feel (in more than one respect). I can't help myself: I'm just a sucker for silly gimmicks and weird themes. I've just *got* to be creative; it's in my bones.

Anyway, check it out if you wanna see what I spend *all* my free time doing. If you've never coded before and you would like to, I'd highly recommend checking out [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) or Khan Academy's [prmgramming section](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/) and learning some languages!
