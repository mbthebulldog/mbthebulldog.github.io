title: Getting Started Wasn't That Easy

After all, I had to figure out how to use Github, Jekyll, Markdown, html, and css just to create this blog. But, as any experienced dev probably knows, that's just the tiniest tip of the heftiest 'berg in the waters. There are so many programming languages out there and, much like human languages, I wish I could learn them all.

Today alone, I've already spent *quite a few hours* studying Jekyll and wearily pulling and pushing every few minutes to check my work. Sometimes it can be daunting to realize *just how much there is to learn*, but I woudln't have it any other way. Not knowing something today…and then knowing it tomorrow – that's what makes all of this so *exhilerating* for me! I mean, I've always had a passion for learning, and technology, and language, but I stupidly hadn't put it all together until now. This just seems like the *absolute best thing* I could be spending my time on. I'm sure (or, I hope) you know the feeling.
