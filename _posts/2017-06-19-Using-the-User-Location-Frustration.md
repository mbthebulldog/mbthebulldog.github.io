title: Using the User (Location Frustration)

This latest challenge was much like the prior. To catch you up (on what I haven't said yet), The first intermediate front-end development project on [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine) had to do with building a webpage (from scratch) which would utilize the API of some JSON databank of quotes to pull one quote at random when the user clicks a button. I seem to have a flair for the dramatic, or at least the almost-funny, so I had a good time designing a webpage replete with mystery and color, small though it be.

Let me tell you, thoughâ€¦those APIs are a tricky business! I was as *surprised* as I was *relieved* when I finally got it working! And the next project was similar: another simple-looking website, this time using the API of a weather service (as well as the user's location) to display the local weather. Once again, I had to put my own hopefully-humorous twist on the whole thing and, once again, I encountered my fair share of *WTF moments*. However, in the end, that only served to heighten my pride and further necessitate the subsequent respite.
